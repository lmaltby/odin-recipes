    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This is a vegetarian take on taco stuffed shells, 
        because my girlfriend and most of her family are 
        vegetarians. Speaking as a non-vegetarian however, 
        these are delicious. So, don't be dissuaded due to
        meat substitutes, and enjoy a fantastic meal!
